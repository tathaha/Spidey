# Spidey, a multipurpose Discord bot

Brief list of features:
- uses slash commands
- music
- ability to launch a game session in a voice channel, such as YouTube Together (`/voicegame`)
- localization support: [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/spidey/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/spidey)
- logging joins/leaves
- adding a role to a user after joining

Music deserves its own section:
- support for skipping non-music segments through [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app) (disabled by default as it can cause unexpected confusion, can be enabled using `/segskipping`)
- support for playing from multiple services including **Spotify and YouTube Music**
- fair queue which prevents users from queueing the same song over and over again (disabled by default, can be enabled using `/fairqueue`), which also has customizable threshold (min 2 songs, max 10, default is 3 songs)
- DJ role (allows to stop the entire playback, enable/disable segment skipping, enable/disable fair queue, set the fair queue threshold or set the default music volume)

Other:
- (edit)snipe commands to snipe deleted/edited messages, which are cached only for 10 minutes from the moment of creation (enabled by default for servers with less than 10k people)
- nsfw commands (locked to nsfw channels)
- uploading emotes from link
- other miscellaneous commands, which you can discover by running `/help`
